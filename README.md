JavaScript Skills Applied

Array Manipulation:
//Created and manipulated arrays to store to-do items and project data (toDoArray, arrayContainerForParentObject).
//Used methods like push, find, and splice to manage tasks and projects dynamically.

DOM Manipulation:
//Dynamically added HTML elements like buttons, input fields, and table rows (createElement, appendChild).
//Updated content on the page based on user input, such as editing task details (textContent, setAttribute).

Event Handling:
//Added event listeners to handle user actions such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks and projects (addEventListener).
//Used custom event handling to trigger changes in the DOM (e.g., calling displayToDoItem when a new to-do is added).

Form Validation:
//Implemented a function to validate input fields before allowing a task or project to be created or updated (validateToDoInputField).
//Displayed alerts to notify users if required fields are empty.

Local Storage:
//Used localStorage to store and retrieve project and to-do data, ensuring persistence between sessions (setItem, getItem).
//Managed storage updates after task creation, deletion, and project updates.

Class-based Structure:
//Created reusable classes (CreateProject, AssignToDoContent) for managing project and task objects.
//Utilized methods inside classes to encapsulate logic for creating, updating, and displaying project and task data.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
//Implemented object-oriented principles by organizing the project into classes with methods that handle specific tasks (e.g., createParentObject, pushParentObject).
//Used static properties in classes for managing unique task IDs (toDoIDCount).

Conditional Logic:
//Applied conditional statements to categorize and display tasks based on urgency and importance (if/else).

Image Importing:
//Imported images dynamically to be used as icons for actions like delete and edit (import myDelete, import myEdit).

Template Literals:
//Used template literals for string interpolation in DOM manipulation (e.g., data-id attributes).

Error Handling:
//Implemented error handling with basic checks, such as ensuring the project name doesnâ€™t already exist (projectExists).
